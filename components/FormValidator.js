/*
Create the FormValidator class, 
which sets settings for validating form fields according to the following requirements:

1. Its constructor has two parameters: 
    a. The first parameter is a settings object that stores selectors and form classes, 
    b. and the second one takes a form element to be validated.

2. It has private methods for processing the form, which include: 
    a. checking the field's validity, 
    b. changing the state of the Submit button, and
    c. adding all the needed handlers.

3. It has a public method enableValidation(), which enables form validation.

4. It has a public method to either disable the state of the button or reset form validation 
(including the state of the submit button). See below for details.
    -In this project, you'll need to refine the behavior of your card form. 
    As a rule, the submission button for all forms should be disabled whenever 
    one or more form fields are invalid. 
    In particular, after successfully submitting the card form, 
    the form fields should be cleared and the submit button should be disabled. 
    Note that this should only be done after successful submission. 
    When the form is closed, but not submitted, it provides a better user experience 
    to leave the form fields as they are, so as to prevent lost data.

    -Note that for the edit profile modal, the button must be disabled after submission. 
    When the user opens the modal again, it will already be filled with valid input values.

Create an instance of the FormValidator class for each form that should be validated.
